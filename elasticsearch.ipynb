      "{'casebody': ['Ward, J.\\nAppellants were charged by information with an assault with intent to kill. The material part of the information reads, as follows:\\n“The said defendants on or about tbe 15th day of January, 1952, in Benton County, Arkansas, did unlawfully, willfully, feloniously, deliberately and with malice aforethought assault Bay Harrison with a deadly weapon, to-wit: An Iron Bod about one and one-half foot long, being then and there held in the hands of Jack Sharpen-steen, Sr., with the unlawful and felonious intent then and there to kill and murder the said Bay Harrison, against the peace and dignity of the State of Arkansas. ’ ’\\nOn March 20, 1952, appellants were tried in circuit court on the above information and convicted by a jury of assault and battery.\\nAppellants prosecute this appeal on the sole ground that, under the former decisions of this court, they cannot be legally convicted of assault and battery under the information set out above. This is no doubt the law under our decisions and particularly as set forth in Jones v. State, 100 Ark. 195, 139 S. W. 1126, which has never been overruled in so far as we are informed. This rule however obtains only where the information fails, as here, to charge an actual battery was committed.\\nBegardless of the above pronouncement however, another question arises. Can appellants, under said information, be convicted of a simple assault? The answer is in the affirmative under the holding in the early case of Cameron v. State, 13 Ark. 712, which holding has been approved and never overruled by this court. The reason for this holding, as expressed in the decisions, is that the two offenses are of the same generic class. See Underwood v. State, 205 Ark. 864, 171 S. W. 2d 304.\\nUnder the above situation this court has the authority to nullify the conviction for a battery and affirm as to a simple assault. For this authority see Jones v. State, supra, and Wills v. State, 193 Ark. 182, 98 S. W. 2d 72.\\nIn affirming a conviction for a simple assault, the question arises as to the amount of fine to he assessed. Appellants were fined $200 for assault and battery, which was the maximum amount prescribed by Ark. Stats. § 41-604. The maximum fine prescribed for a simple assault is $100 under § 41-602. Although appellants could not, as stated above, be convicted of a battery yet evidence of a battery is always admissible in a prosecution for a simple assault to be considered by the jury in fixing the amount of fine to be assessed. The evidence in this case was not brought forward in the record and so we will assume that it justified the maximum penalty. Therefore the maximum penalty of $100 for a simple assault is here approved. See Wills v. State, supra.\\nThe cause is modified as indicated above and otherwise affirmed.']}\n"

       "  'fields': {'casebody': ['Ward, J.\\nAppellants were charged by information with an assault with intent to kill. The material part of the information reads, as follows:\\n“The said defendants on or about tbe 15th day of January, 1952, in Benton County, Arkansas, did unlawfully, willfully, feloniously, deliberately and with malice aforethought assault Bay Harrison with a deadly weapon, to-wit: An Iron Bod about one and one-half foot long, being then and there held in the hands of Jack Sharpen-steen, Sr., with the unlawful and felonious intent then and there to kill and murder the said Bay Harrison, against the peace and dignity of the State of Arkansas. ’ ’\\nOn March 20, 1952, appellants were tried in circuit court on the above information and convicted by a jury of assault and battery.\\nAppellants prosecute this appeal on the sole ground that, under the former decisions of this court, they cannot be legally convicted of assault and battery under the information set out above. This is no doubt the law under our decisions and particularly as set forth in Jones v. State, 100 Ark. 195, 139 S. W. 1126, which has never been overruled in so far as we are informed. This rule however obtains only where the information fails, as here, to charge an actual battery was committed.\\nBegardless of the above pronouncement however, another question arises. Can appellants, under said information, be convicted of a simple assault? The answer is in the affirmative under the holding in the early case of Cameron v. State, 13 Ark. 712, which holding has been approved and never overruled by this court. The reason for this holding, as expressed in the decisions, is that the two offenses are of the same generic class. See Underwood v. State, 205 Ark. 864, 171 S. W. 2d 304.\\nUnder the above situation this court has the authority to nullify the conviction for a battery and affirm as to a simple assault. For this authority see Jones v. State, supra, and Wills v. State, 193 Ark. 182, 98 S. W. 2d 72.\\nIn affirming a conviction for a simple assault, the question arises as to the amount of fine to he assessed. Appellants were fined $200 for assault and battery, which was the maximum amount prescribed by Ark. Stats. § 41-604. The maximum fine prescribed for a simple assault is $100 under § 41-602. Although appellants could not, as stated above, be convicted of a battery yet evidence of a battery is always admissible in a prosecution for a simple assault to be considered by the jury in fixing the amount of fine to be assessed. The evidence in this case was not brought forward in the record and so we will assume that it justified the maximum penalty. Therefore the maximum penalty of $100 for a simple assault is here approved. See Wills v. State, supra.\\nThe cause is modified as indicated above and otherwise affirmed.']}},\n",

       "   'casebody': \"JOHN A. Fogleman, Justice.\\nAppellant contends that the judgment, sentencing him to imprisonment for one year and assessing a fine of $500 in accordance with a jury verdict finding him guilty of assault with a deadly weapon, should be reversed on two grounds. The first is the court’s refusal of appellant’s requested instruction on assault and battery, and the other is the court’s modification of his requested instruction on self-defense. We find no error on either point.\\nAssault and battery is not necessarily a lesser included offense on a charge of assault with a deadly weapon. Clearly, there may be an assault with a deadly weapon without any battery. Appellant was charged with having assaulted W. J. Newlon with a three-foot pipe, with the intent to inflict bodily injury upon the said W. J. Newlon. No part of the charging information contains any allegation that would constitue an allegation that a battery was committed upon Newlon. Assault and battery is the unlawful striking or beating the person of another. Ark. Stat. Ann. § 41-603 (Repl. 1964). The statute defining the offense with which appellant was charged makes one guilty of the crime if he assaults another with a deadly weapon, instrument or thing, with an intent to inflict upon the person of another a bodily injury where no considerable provocation appears, or where the circumstances of the assault show’ an abandoned and malignant disposition. Ark. Stat. Ann. § 41-605 (Repl. 1964). Nothing in the statute makes a battery an essential element of the offense.\\nAppellant first advances the novel argument that, since our statutes do not prohibit the carrying of a three-foot pipe as a weapon, the court’s refusal to instruct on assault and battery constituted a finding that the pipe was a deadly weapon, as a matter of law. Of course, to be guilty of the crime with which appellant was charged, it is not required that one use a deadly weapon. The statute requires the use of a deadly weapon, instrument or other thing. It should go without saying that a three-foot pipe falls into the category of a deadly “instrument or other thing” even if its common or ordinary use is not as a weapon. It is only required that the assault be made with such a deadly weapon, instrument or thing as in the ordinary acceptation is calculated, or likely, to produce death or great bodily injury. Wilson v. State, 162 Ark. 494, 258 S.W. 972.\\nBefore the refusal to instruct the jury on a lesser offense can be said to constitute error, both the charge and the evidence presented must include all the elements of the lesser offense. Caton v. State, 252 Ark. 420, 479 S.W. 2d 537. The evidence in this case would have afforded sufficient basis for a finding of guilt of assault and battery, but, as pointed out above, the charge did not include an essential element of the lesser offense, i.e., battery.\\nAppellant offered an instruction on self-defense pointing out that, in order to make a finding sustaining a self-defense theory, it must have appeared to the defendant at the time of an affray that the danger was so urgent and pressing that, in order to save his own life or prevent his receiving great bodily harm, the striking was necessary and that the person struck was the assailant. This instruction also contained language pointing out that the danger need not be actual or real, but that one claiming self-defense must have acted, in good faith, upon an expectation or fear of danger based upon acts or demonstrations, coupled with any accompanying words, of a person assaulted by the defendant, sufficient to produce in the mind of the defendant a reasonable expectation or fear of death or great bodily harm. The circuit judge gave this instruction with an addition to which appellant objected. The objection was that the added portion was in conflict with that portion requested by appellant, in that it put the matter of self-defense uppn the basis of what defendant could have done rather than the appearance of the situation to the defendant. We find no error.\\nBy the addition the court advised the jury 'that if they believed that appellant, in spite of hostile demonstrations by the prosecuting witness, could have reasonably avoided any danger to himself and averted the necessity for injuring the prosecuting witness, it was his duty to do so. This addition also included a statement to the effect that self-defense may be resorted to only after one has done all in his power, consistent with his own safety, to avoid the danger and avert the necessity of the injury. The addition must be read and considered in connection with that portion of the instruction just preceding it. It seems to us to have been clear that, under the instruction as given, one claiming self-defense may act upon a fear of danger which seems apparent to him, if he acts in good faith, and upon the basis of acts and demonstrations of one he takes to be an aggressor, if they would produce in the mind a reasonable expectation or fear of death or great bodily harm. Nothing in the addition suggests that the danger which one claiming self-defense must avoid should be actual rather than as earlier defined. It should be noted that the judge instructed the jurors that they should not single out any one instruction as being the law in the case, but were to consider all instructions together as being the law. He also fully instructed the jury on the state’s burden, to establish appellant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. When all the instructions are read together, or even all paragraphs of the questioned instruction, we do not see how the jury could have been misled.\\nSince we find no error, the judgment is affirmed.\\nByrD. J., dissents.\\n1\\nSee Ark. Stat. Ann. § 41-4501 (Supp. 1973).\\n2\\nIn his brief here appellant also concluded that the instruction was argumentative, but made no such objection in the circuit court.\",\n",

       "  'fields': {'casebody': [\"JOHN A. Fogleman, Justice.\\nAppellant contends that the judgment, sentencing him to imprisonment for one year and assessing a fine of $500 in accordance with a jury verdict finding him guilty of assault with a deadly weapon, should be reversed on two grounds. The first is the court’s refusal of appellant’s requested instruction on assault and battery, and the other is the court’s modification of his requested instruction on self-defense. We find no error on either point.\\nAssault and battery is not necessarily a lesser included offense on a charge of assault with a deadly weapon. Clearly, there may be an assault with a deadly weapon without any battery. Appellant was charged with having assaulted W. J. Newlon with a three-foot pipe, with the intent to inflict bodily injury upon the said W. J. Newlon. No part of the charging information contains any allegation that would constitue an allegation that a battery was committed upon Newlon. Assault and battery is the unlawful striking or beating the person of another. Ark. Stat. Ann. § 41-603 (Repl. 1964). The statute defining the offense with which appellant was charged makes one guilty of the crime if he assaults another with a deadly weapon, instrument or thing, with an intent to inflict upon the person of another a bodily injury where no considerable provocation appears, or where the circumstances of the assault show’ an abandoned and malignant disposition. Ark. Stat. Ann. § 41-605 (Repl. 1964). Nothing in the statute makes a battery an essential element of the offense.\\nAppellant first advances the novel argument that, since our statutes do not prohibit the carrying of a three-foot pipe as a weapon, the court’s refusal to instruct on assault and battery constituted a finding that the pipe was a deadly weapon, as a matter of law. Of course, to be guilty of the crime with which appellant was charged, it is not required that one use a deadly weapon. The statute requires the use of a deadly weapon, instrument or other thing. It should go without saying that a three-foot pipe falls into the category of a deadly “instrument or other thing” even if its common or ordinary use is not as a weapon. It is only required that the assault be made with such a deadly weapon, instrument or thing as in the ordinary acceptation is calculated, or likely, to produce death or great bodily injury. Wilson v. State, 162 Ark. 494, 258 S.W. 972.\\nBefore the refusal to instruct the jury on a lesser offense can be said to constitute error, both the charge and the evidence presented must include all the elements of the lesser offense. Caton v. State, 252 Ark. 420, 479 S.W. 2d 537. The evidence in this case would have afforded sufficient basis for a finding of guilt of assault and battery, but, as pointed out above, the charge did not include an essential element of the lesser offense, i.e., battery.\\nAppellant offered an instruction on self-defense pointing out that, in order to make a finding sustaining a self-defense theory, it must have appeared to the defendant at the time of an affray that the danger was so urgent and pressing that, in order to save his own life or prevent his receiving great bodily harm, the striking was necessary and that the person struck was the assailant. This instruction also contained language pointing out that the danger need not be actual or real, but that one claiming self-defense must have acted, in good faith, upon an expectation or fear of danger based upon acts or demonstrations, coupled with any accompanying words, of a person assaulted by the defendant, sufficient to produce in the mind of the defendant a reasonable expectation or fear of death or great bodily harm. The circuit judge gave this instruction with an addition to which appellant objected. The objection was that the added portion was in conflict with that portion requested by appellant, in that it put the matter of self-defense uppn the basis of what defendant could have done rather than the appearance of the situation to the defendant. We find no error.\\nBy the addition the court advised the jury 'that if they believed that appellant, in spite of hostile demonstrations by the prosecuting witness, could have reasonably avoided any danger to himself and averted the necessity for injuring the prosecuting witness, it was his duty to do so. This addition also included a statement to the effect that self-defense may be resorted to only after one has done all in his power, consistent with his own safety, to avoid the danger and avert the necessity of the injury. The addition must be read and considered in connection with that portion of the instruction just preceding it. It seems to us to have been clear that, under the instruction as given, one claiming self-defense may act upon a fear of danger which seems apparent to him, if he acts in good faith, and upon the basis of acts and demonstrations of one he takes to be an aggressor, if they would produce in the mind a reasonable expectation or fear of death or great bodily harm. Nothing in the addition suggests that the danger which one claiming self-defense must avoid should be actual rather than as earlier defined. It should be noted that the judge instructed the jurors that they should not single out any one instruction as being the law in the case, but were to consider all instructions together as being the law. He also fully instructed the jury on the state’s burden, to establish appellant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. When all the instructions are read together, or even all paragraphs of the questioned instruction, we do not see how the jury could have been misled.\\nSince we find no error, the judgment is affirmed.\\nByrD. J., dissents.\\n1\\nSee Ark. Stat. Ann. § 41-4501 (Supp. 1973).\\n2\\nIn his brief here appellant also concluded that the instruction was argumentative, but made no such objection in the circuit court.\"]}},\n",

       "   'casebody': 'Frank Holt, Justice.\\nAppellant was convicted of first degree battery, a class B felony. We reversed and remanded. Bolden v. State, 262 Ark. 718, 561 S.W. 2d 881 (1978). On retrial he was again found guilty of first degree battery, receiving a sentence of ten years’ imprisonment. He brings this appeal which was certified to this court from the Court of Appeals pursuant to Rule 29, § (1) (J), Rules of the Arkansas Supreme Court and Court of Appeals.\\nWhen we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the appellee, as we must do on appeal, we agree with appellant there is no substantial evidence to support his conviction for first degree battery. There is no evidence from which the jury could have found, without resorting to surmise and conjecture, that appellant had committed first degree battery under any of the provisions of Ark. Stat. Ann. § 41-1601 (Repl. 1977), which provides in pertinent part:\\n(1) a person commits battery in the first degree if:\\n(a) with the purpose of causing serious physical injury to another person, he causes serious physical injury to any person by means of a deadly weapon; or\\n(b) with the purpose of seriously and permanently disfiguring another person, or of destroying, amputating or permanently disabling a member or organ of his body, he causes such an injury to any person; or\\n(c) he causes serious physical injury to another person under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life; or . . .\\nTo sustain a conviction of first degree battery, “life endangering conduct” must generally be involved; there must be a severe injury in conjunction with a wanton or purposeful culpable mental state; and each recited subsection of § 41-1601, supra, “describes conduct that would produce murder liability if death resulted.” Commentary to § 41-1603. Clearly, an element of first degree battery is the intent to inflict serious physical injury. Golden v. State, 265 Ark. 99, 576 S.W. 2d 955 (1979).\\nHere a policeman testified that he was writing a citation, charging appellant with a traffic offense when he was unexpectedly struck in the back of the head. He was felled and dazed by the blow. A struggle ensued. According to the officer, the appellant and his brother kicked and beat him about his head and chest. The officer suffered a broken jaw and ribs. The officer had not produced (drawn) any weapon when he received the blow; his gun holster was snapped when he received the blow; and he had no idea what type of instrument, if any, caused the injury. His nightstick was in the front part of the car. The appellant was in the back seat of the patrol car, within reach of the nightstick, immediately prior to his receiving the blow. The officer did not know what caused the injury. The physician who examined the officer shortly after the incident testified that he had not observed any contusion on the officer’s head, and there was no physical evidence of a severe blow to the back of the head. With regard to his jaw injury, the officer testified that he did not know what had caused the injury, although, as previously indicated, appellant and his brother kicked and beat him about his head and chest. Although the officer testified that the appellant got possession of his gun during the struggle, pointed it at him, and threatened to kill him, he did not testify that the appellant had struck him with the gun, nightstick or any weapon. The physician testified that the injury could have resulted from a blow from someone’s fist. The appellant admitted only that it was possible he hit the officer with his elbow during the scuffle.\\nThis recited evidence would only justify a conviction of second degree battery pursuant to § 41-1602 which provides in pertinent part:\\n(1) A person commits battery in the second degree if: (a) with the purpose of causing physical injury to another person; . . . or . . .\\n(c) with the purpose of preventing a law enforcement officer or fireman from acting in the line of duty, he causes physical injury to any person . . .\\nAppellant’s other assignments for reversal have no merit since they are unsupported by convincing argument or citation of authority. Dixon v. State, 260 Ark. 857, 545 S.W. 2d 606 (1977).\\nSince the evidence is insufficient to support a conviction of first degree battery, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.\\nHickman, J., concurs.\\nStroud & Mays, JJ., not participating.',\n",

       "  'fields': {'casebody': ['Frank Holt, Justice.\\nAppellant was convicted of first degree battery, a class B felony. We reversed and remanded. Bolden v. State, 262 Ark. 718, 561 S.W. 2d 881 (1978). On retrial he was again found guilty of first degree battery, receiving a sentence of ten years’ imprisonment. He brings this appeal which was certified to this court from the Court of Appeals pursuant to Rule 29, § (1) (J), Rules of the Arkansas Supreme Court and Court of Appeals.\\nWhen we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the appellee, as we must do on appeal, we agree with appellant there is no substantial evidence to support his conviction for first degree battery. There is no evidence from which the jury could have found, without resorting to surmise and conjecture, that appellant had committed first degree battery under any of the provisions of Ark. Stat. Ann. § 41-1601 (Repl. 1977), which provides in pertinent part:\\n(1) a person commits battery in the first degree if:\\n(a) with the purpose of causing serious physical injury to another person, he causes serious physical injury to any person by means of a deadly weapon; or\\n(b) with the purpose of seriously and permanently disfiguring another person, or of destroying, amputating or permanently disabling a member or organ of his body, he causes such an injury to any person; or\\n(c) he causes serious physical injury to another person under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life; or . . .\\nTo sustain a conviction of first degree battery, “life endangering conduct” must generally be involved; there must be a severe injury in conjunction with a wanton or purposeful culpable mental state; and each recited subsection of § 41-1601, supra, “describes conduct that would produce murder liability if death resulted.” Commentary to § 41-1603. Clearly, an element of first degree battery is the intent to inflict serious physical injury. Golden v. State, 265 Ark. 99, 576 S.W. 2d 955 (1979).\\nHere a policeman testified that he was writing a citation, charging appellant with a traffic offense when he was unexpectedly struck in the back of the head. He was felled and dazed by the blow. A struggle ensued. According to the officer, the appellant and his brother kicked and beat him about his head and chest. The officer suffered a broken jaw and ribs. The officer had not produced (drawn) any weapon when he received the blow; his gun holster was snapped when he received the blow; and he had no idea what type of instrument, if any, caused the injury. His nightstick was in the front part of the car. The appellant was in the back seat of the patrol car, within reach of the nightstick, immediately prior to his receiving the blow. The officer did not know what caused the injury. The physician who examined the officer shortly after the incident testified that he had not observed any contusion on the officer’s head, and there was no physical evidence of a severe blow to the back of the head. With regard to his jaw injury, the officer testified that he did not know what had caused the injury, although, as previously indicated, appellant and his brother kicked and beat him about his head and chest. Although the officer testified that the appellant got possession of his gun during the struggle, pointed it at him, and threatened to kill him, he did not testify that the appellant had struck him with the gun, nightstick or any weapon. The physician testified that the injury could have resulted from a blow from someone’s fist. The appellant admitted only that it was possible he hit the officer with his elbow during the scuffle.\\nThis recited evidence would only justify a conviction of second degree battery pursuant to § 41-1602 which provides in pertinent part:\\n(1) A person commits battery in the second degree if: (a) with the purpose of causing physical injury to another person; . . . or . . .\\n(c) with the purpose of preventing a law enforcement officer or fireman from acting in the line of duty, he causes physical injury to any person . . .\\nAppellant’s other assignments for reversal have no merit since they are unsupported by convincing argument or citation of authority. Dixon v. State, 260 Ark. 857, 545 S.W. 2d 606 (1977).\\nSince the evidence is insufficient to support a conviction of first degree battery, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.\\nHickman, J., concurs.\\nStroud & Mays, JJ., not participating.']}},\n",

       "   'casebody': 'Tom Glaze, Justice.\\nThis criminal appeal involves a battery charge brought against the appellant after he beat his wife. The incident occurred on August 10,1983, when appellant threatened his wife by brandishing a pistol in her face, and later that night beat her unmercifully. After the beating, appellant first was arrested for public intoxication and then a second degree battery charge was apparently added. That battery charge was apparently reduced since the record shows a third degree battery charge was nolle pressed on January 4,1984, when appellant was charged in circuit court with first degree battery. After numerous delays and trial settings, appellant was tried and convicted on March 5, 1987, and sentenced to twenty years imprisonment. Appellant argues on appeal that the state violated his right to a speedy trial. We do not agree, and therefore affirm.\\nIn their arguments, the appellant and the state disagree on when the time should commence in calculating the eighteen-month period within which the appellant was required to be tried. See A.R.Cr.P. 28.1(c). Appellant cites A.R.Cr.P. 28.2(a) and contends the time commenced on August 10, 1983, the date of arrest. The state claims the time commenced on January 4,1984, the date the first degree battery charge was filed. In support of its claim, the state argues there is no proof the appellant’s arrest on August 10, 1983, was for the battery charge with which he was finally charged and convicted. From our review of the record, we conclude the parties’ disagreement over these dates has no legal significance because the state still tried the appellant within the time prescribed by law even when we employ the earlier date of August 10, 1983.\\nThe appellant was tried on March 5,1987, nearly forty-three months after his arrest on August 10,1983, and well outside the required eighteen-month period in effect at the time. That being so, the state has the burden of showing that any delay was the result of appellant’s conduct or was otherwise justified. Gooden v. State, 295 Ark. 385, 749 S.W.2d 657 (1988). The periods that must be excluded when computing appellant’s trial under Arkansas’s speedy trial rules are set out in A.R.Cr.P. 28.3(a) and (e). Those relevant, excludable periods involve delays that resulted from the appellant’s pretrial motion to dismiss, his request for a competency evaluation and his unauthorized absence from both the state and various trial dates. The chronology of significant events is as follows:\\nAs we previously noted, appellant’s trial was held approximately forty-three months — specifically 1,301 days — after his arrest. During this time, appellant received six different trial settings, and he left the state twice without notifying the court. In analyzing the foregoing list of events, the first excludable period of 340 days resulted because appellant’s whereabouts were unknown. Sergeant Ike Wei ton testified that the appellant, after his arrest on August 10, 1983, had the duty to notify his bondsman and the court of any address changes. Nevertheless, after the first degree battery charge was filed on January 4, 1984, Welton said his department mailed an arrest warrant to the address given them by appellant. The officer received no reply. On March 20, 1984, an officer was sent to arrest appellant at his residence, but the officer learned the appellant had left three months earlier and had not returned. In fact, appellant was later located and arrested in Louisville, Kentucky on November 3, 1984, and extradited to Arkansas on December 12, 1984. In sum, the state showed that on March 20, 1984, the officers discovered that appellant had left his residence three months earlier and did not find him until he was arrested in and extradited from Kentucky. Under these circumstances, appellant’s whereabouts were unknown to the state and the delay resulting during this period was caused by his own action and excludable under Rule 28.3(e).\\nAnother period excludable under Rule 28.3(e) occurred when the appellant failed to appear for trial, which had been set for July 26, 1985. Again, appellant was located and arrested in Kentucky on January 30, 1986, a 188-day period of delay. That period, we conclude, is excludable because he absented himself from the court without notifying the court or requesting its permission to do so.\\nThe next excludable period resulted from the appellant’s pretrial motions in which he requested the case be dismissed because the state violated the speedy trial laws. After fourteen days, the court denied the appellant’s motion. This period was excludable under Rule 28.3(a).\\nFinally, a 223-day period of delay resulted from proceedings concerning the examination and evaluation of the appellant’s competency to stand trial and to determine if he lacked the capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or conform his conduct to the requirements of the law when the crime was committed. Again, this period of time is specifically excludable under Rule 28.3(a).\\nIn adding the excludable periods noted above, they total 765 days, leaving only 536 days — less than eighteen months — of the original 1,301 days (or nearly forty-three-month period) between the appellant’s initial arrest (8-10-83) and when he was tried (3-5-87). Because the record and proof reflect the appellant was tried within the legally required eighteen-month period, we uphold the trial court’s decision denying the appellant’s request to dismiss this cause for violation of the speedy trial laws.\\nPurtle, J., dissents. Dudley, J., concurs.\\n1\\nAppellant cited A.R.Cr.P. 28.2 and argued that the first degree battery charge was based on the same conduct as the earlier charges, so the time would still commence when he was first arrested.\\n2\\nThe appellant does not mention Glover v. Stale, 287 Ark. 19, 695 S.W.2d 829 (1985), wherein the state showed it had mailed the defendant a notice of a trial setting to his last known address, but it received no reply. We held the state failed to prove the defendant was not at the address; also the defendant and his mother testified he lived at that address and never received a trial notice. The present case is clearly distinguishable because the unrebutted testimony reflects the defendant had removed himself from the residence (address) given the court months before the officers tried to locate and arrest him.\\n3\\nAppellant also argues the trial court failed, as required under A.R.Cr.P. 28.3(i), to set forth the number of excludable days in a written order or docket entry, but since that issue was not presented below, we do not consider it on appeal. See Gooden v. State, 295 Ark. 385, 749 S.W.2d 657 (1988).',\n",

       "  'fields': {'casebody': ['Tom Glaze, Justice.\\nThis criminal appeal involves a battery charge brought against the appellant after he beat his wife. The incident occurred on August 10,1983, when appellant threatened his wife by brandishing a pistol in her face, and later that night beat her unmercifully. After the beating, appellant first was arrested for public intoxication and then a second degree battery charge was apparently added. That battery charge was apparently reduced since the record shows a third degree battery charge was nolle pressed on January 4,1984, when appellant was charged in circuit court with first degree battery. After numerous delays and trial settings, appellant was tried and convicted on March 5, 1987, and sentenced to twenty years imprisonment. Appellant argues on appeal that the state violated his right to a speedy trial. We do not agree, and therefore affirm.\\nIn their arguments, the appellant and the state disagree on when the time should commence in calculating the eighteen-month period within which the appellant was required to be tried. See A.R.Cr.P. 28.1(c). Appellant cites A.R.Cr.P. 28.2(a) and contends the time commenced on August 10, 1983, the date of arrest. The state claims the time commenced on January 4,1984, the date the first degree battery charge was filed. In support of its claim, the state argues there is no proof the appellant’s arrest on August 10, 1983, was for the battery charge with which he was finally charged and convicted. From our review of the record, we conclude the parties’ disagreement over these dates has no legal significance because the state still tried the appellant within the time prescribed by law even when we employ the earlier date of August 10, 1983.\\nThe appellant was tried on March 5,1987, nearly forty-three months after his arrest on August 10,1983, and well outside the required eighteen-month period in effect at the time. That being so, the state has the burden of showing that any delay was the result of appellant’s conduct or was otherwise justified. Gooden v. State, 295 Ark. 385, 749 S.W.2d 657 (1988). The periods that must be excluded when computing appellant’s trial under Arkansas’s speedy trial rules are set out in A.R.Cr.P. 28.3(a) and (e). Those relevant, excludable periods involve delays that resulted from the appellant’s pretrial motion to dismiss, his request for a competency evaluation and his unauthorized absence from both the state and various trial dates. The chronology of significant events is as follows:\\nAs we previously noted, appellant’s trial was held approximately forty-three months — specifically 1,301 days — after his arrest. During this time, appellant received six different trial settings, and he left the state twice without notifying the court. In analyzing the foregoing list of events, the first excludable period of 340 days resulted because appellant’s whereabouts were unknown. Sergeant Ike Wei ton testified that the appellant, after his arrest on August 10, 1983, had the duty to notify his bondsman and the court of any address changes. Nevertheless, after the first degree battery charge was filed on January 4, 1984, Welton said his department mailed an arrest warrant to the address given them by appellant. The officer received no reply. On March 20, 1984, an officer was sent to arrest appellant at his residence, but the officer learned the appellant had left three months earlier and had not returned. In fact, appellant was later located and arrested in Louisville, Kentucky on November 3, 1984, and extradited to Arkansas on December 12, 1984. In sum, the state showed that on March 20, 1984, the officers discovered that appellant had left his residence three months earlier and did not find him until he was arrested in and extradited from Kentucky. Under these circumstances, appellant’s whereabouts were unknown to the state and the delay resulting during this period was caused by his own action and excludable under Rule 28.3(e).\\nAnother period excludable under Rule 28.3(e) occurred when the appellant failed to appear for trial, which had been set for July 26, 1985. Again, appellant was located and arrested in Kentucky on January 30, 1986, a 188-day period of delay. That period, we conclude, is excludable because he absented himself from the court without notifying the court or requesting its permission to do so.\\nThe next excludable period resulted from the appellant’s pretrial motions in which he requested the case be dismissed because the state violated the speedy trial laws. After fourteen days, the court denied the appellant’s motion. This period was excludable under Rule 28.3(a).\\nFinally, a 223-day period of delay resulted from proceedings concerning the examination and evaluation of the appellant’s competency to stand trial and to determine if he lacked the capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or conform his conduct to the requirements of the law when the crime was committed. Again, this period of time is specifically excludable under Rule 28.3(a).\\nIn adding the excludable periods noted above, they total 765 days, leaving only 536 days — less than eighteen months — of the original 1,301 days (or nearly forty-three-month period) between the appellant’s initial arrest (8-10-83) and when he was tried (3-5-87). Because the record and proof reflect the appellant was tried within the legally required eighteen-month period, we uphold the trial court’s decision denying the appellant’s request to dismiss this cause for violation of the speedy trial laws.\\nPurtle, J., dissents. Dudley, J., concurs.\\n1\\nAppellant cited A.R.Cr.P. 28.2 and argued that the first degree battery charge was based on the same conduct as the earlier charges, so the time would still commence when he was first arrested.\\n2\\nThe appellant does not mention Glover v. Stale, 287 Ark. 19, 695 S.W.2d 829 (1985), wherein the state showed it had mailed the defendant a notice of a trial setting to his last known address, but it received no reply. We held the state failed to prove the defendant was not at the address; also the defendant and his mother testified he lived at that address and never received a trial notice. The present case is clearly distinguishable because the unrebutted testimony reflects the defendant had removed himself from the residence (address) given the court months before the officers tried to locate and arrest him.\\n3\\nAppellant also argues the trial court failed, as required under A.R.Cr.P. 28.3(i), to set forth the number of excludable days in a written order or docket entry, but since that issue was not presented below, we do not consider it on appeal. See Gooden v. State, 295 Ark. 385, 749 S.W.2d 657 (1988).']}},\n",

       "   'casebody': 'Robert H. Dudley, Justice.\\nDuring the late evening and early morning of December 7 and 8,1984, the appellant committed two burglaries, an aggravated assault, a battery, a kidnapping, and a rape, before committing the burglary and the second degree battery which are on appeal in this case. The appellant contends the evidence in the two cases on appeal is insufficient to support the convictions. We find no merit in the argument and affirm both judgments of conviction.\\nIn the early evening of December 7,1984, Terry Nolen and his wife, Kay, went shopping and then returned to their home in west Little Rock where they decorated their Christmas tree, wrapped presents, put their children to bed, and began watching the late movie on television. While in the den watching the movie, the Nolens dozed off. At this time, unknown to the Nolens, the appellant was beginning his rampage in the neighborhood. Sometime between 12:30 and 1:00 a.m., they were awakened by a noise. They looked up and saw a man standing in front of them. His blue jeans were unbuttoned at the waist, and the fly was partially unzipped. The intruder, appellant, never spoke but motioned for Terry Nolen to go into the kitchen. Nolen started toward the kitchen when appellant grabbed him by the right arm, turned him around, and hit him on the side of the face, and knocked his glasses off. Appellant hit him again, and Nolen started to fight back. Nolen tackled the appellant, and in so doing, Nolen broke his kneecap on the den floor. Appellant then ran out of the Nolen’s house and was captured a short distance away.\\nAppellant argues that the evidence is insufficient to sustain the conviction for second degree battery. The second degree battery statute, Ark. Stat. Ann. § 41-1602(1 )(a) (Supp. 1983), contains three elements: (1) a battery, (2) committed with the purpose of causing physical injury, and (3) causing serious physical injury. Appellant, in effect, argues that he only intended to cause physical injury, not serious physical injury, and therefore, the third element is missing. The argument is based on a misconstruction of the statute. The only specific intent required by the statute is the intent to cause physical injury. Unquestionably, twice striking Nolen on the side of the face with his fist was evidence of an intent to cause physical injury. The third element, causing serious physical injury, was supplied when the serious physical injury actually occurred.\\nIn anticipation of the above holding, appellant argues that even if the only intent required was the intent to commit physical injury, and he was found to have that intent at the time he struck Nolen, that intent had ceased by the time that Nolen broke his kneecap. Thus, he argues, he did not have the requisite intent to cause physical injury at the moment the serious physical injury occurred. The argument is without factual support. Viewing the evidence most favorably to the appellee, as we must do, the blows to Nolen and the breaking of the kneecap were a part of one continuous occurrence. There was evidence to indicate that the prerequisite intent was still present.\\nIn addition, the appellant argues that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the conviction for burglary. The elements of the crime of burglary are: (1) the entering or remaining unlawfully in an occupiable structure of another person, (2) with the purpose of committing therein an offense punishable by imprisonment. Ark. Stat. Ann. § 41-2002(1) (Repl. 1977). Appellant does not dispute that the evidence was sufficient on the first element, entry. Instead, he argues that the State did not prove the second element, intent to commit an offense punishable by imprisonment. The short answer to the argument is that the State did prove by direct evidence that while inside the victim’s home the appellant did, in fact, intentionally commit an offense punishable by imprisonment, second degree battery.\\nAffirmed.\\nPurtle, J., not participating.',\n",

       "  'fields': {'casebody': ['Robert H. Dudley, Justice.\\nDuring the late evening and early morning of December 7 and 8,1984, the appellant committed two burglaries, an aggravated assault, a battery, a kidnapping, and a rape, before committing the burglary and the second degree battery which are on appeal in this case. The appellant contends the evidence in the two cases on appeal is insufficient to support the convictions. We find no merit in the argument and affirm both judgments of conviction.\\nIn the early evening of December 7,1984, Terry Nolen and his wife, Kay, went shopping and then returned to their home in west Little Rock where they decorated their Christmas tree, wrapped presents, put their children to bed, and began watching the late movie on television. While in the den watching the movie, the Nolens dozed off. At this time, unknown to the Nolens, the appellant was beginning his rampage in the neighborhood. Sometime between 12:30 and 1:00 a.m., they were awakened by a noise. They looked up and saw a man standing in front of them. His blue jeans were unbuttoned at the waist, and the fly was partially unzipped. The intruder, appellant, never spoke but motioned for Terry Nolen to go into the kitchen. Nolen started toward the kitchen when appellant grabbed him by the right arm, turned him around, and hit him on the side of the face, and knocked his glasses off. Appellant hit him again, and Nolen started to fight back. Nolen tackled the appellant, and in so doing, Nolen broke his kneecap on the den floor. Appellant then ran out of the Nolen’s house and was captured a short distance away.\\nAppellant argues that the evidence is insufficient to sustain the conviction for second degree battery. The second degree battery statute, Ark. Stat. Ann. § 41-1602(1 )(a) (Supp. 1983), contains three elements: (1) a battery, (2) committed with the purpose of causing physical injury, and (3) causing serious physical injury. Appellant, in effect, argues that he only intended to cause physical injury, not serious physical injury, and therefore, the third element is missing. The argument is based on a misconstruction of the statute. The only specific intent required by the statute is the intent to cause physical injury. Unquestionably, twice striking Nolen on the side of the face with his fist was evidence of an intent to cause physical injury. The third element, causing serious physical injury, was supplied when the serious physical injury actually occurred.\\nIn anticipation of the above holding, appellant argues that even if the only intent required was the intent to commit physical injury, and he was found to have that intent at the time he struck Nolen, that intent had ceased by the time that Nolen broke his kneecap. Thus, he argues, he did not have the requisite intent to cause physical injury at the moment the serious physical injury occurred. The argument is without factual support. Viewing the evidence most favorably to the appellee, as we must do, the blows to Nolen and the breaking of the kneecap were a part of one continuous occurrence. There was evidence to indicate that the prerequisite intent was still present.\\nIn addition, the appellant argues that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the conviction for burglary. The elements of the crime of burglary are: (1) the entering or remaining unlawfully in an occupiable structure of another person, (2) with the purpose of committing therein an offense punishable by imprisonment. Ark. Stat. Ann. § 41-2002(1) (Repl. 1977). Appellant does not dispute that the evidence was sufficient on the first element, entry. Instead, he argues that the State did not prove the second element, intent to commit an offense punishable by imprisonment. The short answer to the argument is that the State did prove by direct evidence that while inside the victim’s home the appellant did, in fact, intentionally commit an offense punishable by imprisonment, second degree battery.\\nAffirmed.\\nPurtle, J., not participating.']}}]"

       "['Karen R. Baker, Judge.\\nThis is an administrative appeal from the Arkansas Professional Bail Bond Company and Professional Bail Bondsman Licensing Board. The appellant, Elizabeth Frawley, is a licensed bail bondsman who was employed by appellant, J & J Bonding, Inc., on December 16, 1997. Appellant Frawley was notified by the Board that she solicited business or advertised for business in or about a place where prisoners were confined in violation of Ark. Code Ann. section 17-19-105(2). Appellant J & J Bonding, Inc. was notified that it was responsible for Ms. Frawley’s actions pursuant to Ark. Code Ann. section 17-19-210(b) because she was acting within the scope of her authority as a J & J bondsman. The statutory prohibition against solicitation reads as follows:\\nNo professional bail bondsman or professional bail bond company, nor court, nor law enforcement officer nor any individual working on behalf of a professional bail bondsman or professional bail bond company shall: . . .(2) Solicit business or advertise for business in or about any place where prisoners are confined or in or about any court; ....\\nArk. Code Ann. § 17-19-105(2) (Supp.1999).\\nThis prohibition was amended in 1997 with an effective date of July 1, 1997. The amendment inserted the language “nor any individual working on behalf of a professional bail bondsman or professional bail bond company” in the introductory language. Id. (commentary).\\nThe charges in this case were based upon allegations that Dixie Hinerman, a friend of Ms. Frawley’s, accompanied Ms. Frawley to the Pulaski County jail and distributed business cards of Ms. Frawley’s to a trusty and others at the facility. A hearing was held before the Board on March 13, 1998, and the Board found appellants guilty of the charges. The Board suspended Ms. Frawley’s license for ninety days and imposed a fine of $2,500 against J & J Bonding. Appellants timely appealed the Board’s decision and argued to the circuit court, and again in this appeal, that there was no evidence of an agency relationship between Ms. Hinerman and Ms. Frawley. They urge that without evidence of an agency relationship, Ms. Hinerman’s actions on December 16, 1997, should not have been imputed to Ms. Frawley. In addition, they argue that the punishments imposed were unduly harsh and excessive.\\nThis court’s review, like that of the circuit court, is limited in scope and is directed not to the decision of the circuit court, but to the decision of the administrative agency. Tomerlin & All Arkansas Bail Bond Co., Inc. v. Nickolich, 342 Ark. 325, 331, 27 S.W.3d 746, 749 (2000) (citing Arkans as Bd. Of Exam’rs v. Carlson, 334 Ark. 614, 976 S.W.2d 934 (1998)); Arkansas Dept. of Human Servs. v. Thompson, 331 Ark. 181, 959 S.W.2d 46 (1998). Our review is limited to ascertaining whether there is substantial evidence to support the agency’s decision. Id.\\nThe Arkansas Supreme Court set forth the following test for determining whether substantial evidence supports the agency’s decision:\\nSubstantial evidence has been defined as valid, legal, and persuasive evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion, and force the mind to pass beyond conjecture. The challenging party has the burden of proving an absence of substantial evidence. To establish an absence of substantial evidence to support the decision the challenging party must demonstrate that the proof before the administrative tribunal was so nearly undisputed that fair-minded persons could not reach its conclusion. The question is not whether the testimony would have supported a contrary finding but whether it supports the finding that was made. It is the prerogative of the agency to believe or disbelieve any witness and to decide what weight to accord the evidence.\\nArkansas State Police Comm’n v. Smith, 338 Ark. 354, 362, 994 S.W.2d 456, 461 (1999)(citations omitted).\\nTo prevail, appellants must demonstrate that the proof before the administrative tribunal was so nearly undisputed that fair-minded persons could not reach the conclusion that Ms. Hinerman was working on behalf of appellants when she distributed Ms. Frawley’s business cards at the Pulaski County jail.\\nThe following facts were largely undisputed. On December 16, 1997, Ms. Hinerman accompanied Ms. Frawley to the Pulaski County jail. Ms. Frawley left her cellular phone with • Ms. Hinerman outside the facility and entered the jail on a bond matter. While Ms. Frawley was inside the facility, Ms. Hinerman gave several of Ms. Frawley’s business cards to an inmate with trusty status and told him to take the cards into the jail and pass them out to anyone who needed them. She also passed out cards to other individuals. At least one of these cards had Ms. Hinerman’s name handwritten with “Sec.” to indicate secretary. All of the cards had both Ms. Frawley’s and J & J Bonding’s names imprinted. The cards also listed Ms. Frawley’s cellular phone number. Although not paid by Ms. Frawley, Ms. Hinerman helped Ms. Frawley by driving around with her and answering her cellular phone. When answering the telephone for Ms. Frawley, Ms. Hinerman would gather the caller’s name, phone number, and information about the person for whom a bond was sought. She denied giving specific information about fees for obtaining a bond and claimed she only answered a few phone calls. Both Ms. Frawley and J & J Bonding would receive the financial benefit of any bail bond business solicited by Ms. Hinerman through the distribution of cards on December 16, 1997, in or about the premises of the Pulaski County jail. Ms. Frawley denied knowing that Ms. Hinerman was distributing the cards at the time of distribution, but said she was upset with Ms. Hinerman when she found out and told her never to do it again.\\nThe Arkansas Supreme Court adopted the definition of agency contained in the Second Restatement of the Law of Agency, § 1, comment a, which provides that the relation of agency is created as the result of conduct by two parties manifesting that one of them is willing for the other to act for him subject to his control, and that the other consents so to act. The principal must in some manner indicate that the agent is to act for him, and the agent must act or agree to act on the principal’s behalf and subject to his control. Evans v. White, 284 Ark. 376, 682 S.W.2d 733 (1985) (citing Crouch v. Twin City Transit, 245 Ark. 778, 434 S.W.2d 816 (1968)). The two essential elements of the definition are authorization and right to control. Id.\\nThere is substantial evidence from which the Board could conclude that Ms. Hinerman was acting on behalf of Ms. Frawley when distributing her business cards at the jail. Ms. Frawley left Ms. Hinerman with access to her business cards and cellular phone and gave instructions to obtain certain information from the callers regarding their bonding needs. The cards had Ms. Frawley’s cellular phone number on them. Ms. Frawley left Ms. Hinerman outside the detention facility while she was inside preparing a bond on behalf of J & J Bonding. Appellants fail to demonstrate how a fair-minded person could not reach the conclusion that Ms. Frawley in some manner indicated that Ms. Hinerman was to act for her. Neither have appellants demonstrated that a fair-minded person could not reach the conclusion that Ms. Hinerman acted on appellants’ behalf. It is logical to conclude that someone who received a business card could contact Ms. Frawley and J & J Bonding for a bond and therefore the distribution of the card was on appellants’ behalf. Even if no one contacted appellants as a result of the distribution, Ms. Hinerman’s actions were still on behalf of appellants in that she was providing individuals with the name and number of a bail bondsman. Similarly, Ms. Frawley’s instruction to Ms. Hinerman to never pass out the cards again at a jail supports the conclusion that Ms. Hinerman was subject to appellants’ control in some way, whether or not appellants had prior knowledge of this specific distribution of cards by Ms. Hinerman. Therefore, Ms. Frawley is accountable for Ms. Hinerman’s actions. In addition, substantial evidence supports the finding that Ms. Frawley was acting within the scope of her employment as a J & J bondsman, and J & J was properly held accountable pursuant to statute.\\nRegarding the sanctions imposed, Ms. Frawley’s ninety-day suspension is not an abuse of discretion or unduly harsh, particularly in fight of the fact that under Ark. Code Ann. section 17-19-210(a) she was subject to a one-year suspension. Likewise, J &J Bonding’s fine of $2500, in lieu of suspension or revocation of its license as an administrative penalty pursuant to section 17-19-211, was in the mid-range of fines. The sanctions are fair and reasonable.\\nAccordingly, we affirm.\\nAffirmed.\\nGriffen and CRABTREE, JJ.,agree.']"
