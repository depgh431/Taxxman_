0,Assault and battery ,"['Ward, J.\nAppellants were charged by information with an assault with intent to kill. The material part of the information reads, as follows:\n“The said defendants on or about tbe 15th day of January, 1952, in Benton County, Arkansas, did unlawfully, willfully, feloniously, deliberately and with malice aforethought assault Bay Harrison with a deadly weapon, to-wit: An Iron Bod about one and one-half foot long, being then and there held in the hands of Jack Sharpen-steen, Sr., with the unlawful and felonious intent then and there to kill and murder the said Bay Harrison, against the peace and dignity of the State of Arkansas. ’ ’\nOn March 20, 1952, appellants were tried in circuit court on the above information and convicted by a jury of assault and battery.\nAppellants prosecute this appeal on the sole ground that, under the former decisions of this court, they cannot be legally convicted of assault and battery under the information set out above. This is no doubt the law under our decisions and particularly as set forth in Jones v. State, 100 Ark. 195, 139 S. W. 1126, which has never been overruled in so far as we are informed. This rule however obtains only where the information fails, as here, to charge an actual battery was committed.\nBegardless of the above pronouncement however, another question arises. Can appellants, under said information, be convicted of a simple assault? The answer is in the affirmative under the holding in the early case of Cameron v. State, 13 Ark. 712, which holding has been approved and never overruled by this court. The reason for this holding, as expressed in the decisions, is that the two offenses are of the same generic class. See Underwood v. State, 205 Ark. 864, 171 S. W. 2d 304.\nUnder the above situation this court has the authority to nullify the conviction for a battery and affirm as to a simple assault. For this authority see Jones v. State, supra, and Wills v. State, 193 Ark. 182, 98 S. W. 2d 72.\nIn affirming a conviction for a simple assault, the question arises as to the amount of fine to he assessed. Appellants were fined $200 for assault and battery, which was the maximum amount prescribed by Ark. Stats. § 41-604. The maximum fine prescribed for a simple assault is $100 under § 41-602. Although appellants could not, as stated above, be convicted of a battery yet evidence of a battery is always admissible in a prosecution for a simple assault to be considered by the jury in fixing the amount of fine to be assessed. The evidence in this case was not brought forward in the record and so we will assume that it justified the maximum penalty. Therefore the maximum penalty of $100 for a simple assault is here approved. See Wills v. State, supra.\nThe cause is modified as indicated above and otherwise affirmed.']"
1,special bail,"['Karen R. Baker, Judge.\nThis is an administrative appeal from the Arkansas Professional Bail Bond Company and Professional Bail Bondsman Licensing Board. The appellant, Elizabeth Frawley, is a licensed bail bondsman who was employed by appellant, J & J Bonding, Inc., on December 16, 1997. Appellant Frawley was notified by the Board that she solicited business or advertised for business in or about a place where prisoners were confined in violation of Ark. Code Ann. section 17-19-105(2). Appellant J & J Bonding, Inc. was notified that it was responsible for Ms. Frawley’s actions pursuant to Ark. Code Ann. section 17-19-210(b) because she was acting within the scope of her authority as a J & J bondsman. The statutory prohibition against solicitation reads as follows:\nNo professional bail bondsman or professional bail bond company, nor court, nor law enforcement officer nor any individual working on behalf of a professional bail bondsman or professional bail bond company shall: . . .(2) Solicit business or advertise for business in or about any place where prisoners are confined or in or about any court; ....\nArk. Code Ann. § 17-19-105(2) (Supp.1999).\nThis prohibition was amended in 1997 with an effective date of July 1, 1997. The amendment inserted the language “nor any individual working on behalf of a professional bail bondsman or professional bail bond company” in the introductory language. Id. (commentary).\nThe charges in this case were based upon allegations that Dixie Hinerman, a friend of Ms. Frawley’s, accompanied Ms. Frawley to the Pulaski County jail and distributed business cards of Ms. Frawley’s to a trusty and others at the facility. A hearing was held before the Board on March 13, 1998, and the Board found appellants guilty of the charges. The Board suspended Ms. Frawley’s license for ninety days and imposed a fine of $2,500 against J & J Bonding. Appellants timely appealed the Board’s decision and argued to the circuit court, and again in this appeal, that there was no evidence of an agency relationship between Ms. Hinerman and Ms. Frawley. They urge that without evidence of an agency relationship, Ms. Hinerman’s actions on December 16, 1997, should not have been imputed to Ms. Frawley. In addition, they argue that the punishments imposed were unduly harsh and excessive.\nThis court’s review, like that of the circuit court, is limited in scope and is directed not to the decision of the circuit court, but to the decision of the administrative agency. Tomerlin & All Arkansas Bail Bond Co., Inc. v. Nickolich, 342 Ark. 325, 331, 27 S.W.3d 746, 749 (2000) (citing Arkans as Bd. Of Exam’rs v. Carlson, 334 Ark. 614, 976 S.W.2d 934 (1998)); Arkansas Dept. of Human Servs. v. Thompson, 331 Ark. 181, 959 S.W.2d 46 (1998). Our review is limited to ascertaining whether there is substantial evidence to support the agency’s decision. Id.\nThe Arkansas Supreme Court set forth the following test for determining whether substantial evidence supports the agency’s decision:\nSubstantial evidence has been defined as valid, legal, and persuasive evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion, and force the mind to pass beyond conjecture. The challenging party has the burden of proving an absence of substantial evidence. To establish an absence of substantial evidence to support the decision the challenging party must demonstrate that the proof before the administrative tribunal was so nearly undisputed that fair-minded persons could not reach its conclusion. The question is not whether the testimony would have supported a contrary finding but whether it supports the finding that was made. It is the prerogative of the agency to believe or disbelieve any witness and to decide what weight to accord the evidence.\nArkansas State Police Comm’n v. Smith, 338 Ark. 354, 362, 994 S.W.2d 456, 461 (1999)(citations omitted).\nTo prevail, appellants must demonstrate that the proof before the administrative tribunal was so nearly undisputed that fair-minded persons could not reach the conclusion that Ms. Hinerman was working on behalf of appellants when she distributed Ms. Frawley’s business cards at the Pulaski County jail.\nThe following facts were largely undisputed. On December 16, 1997, Ms. Hinerman accompanied Ms. Frawley to the Pulaski County jail. Ms. Frawley left her cellular phone with • Ms. Hinerman outside the facility and entered the jail on a bond matter. While Ms. Frawley was inside the facility, Ms. Hinerman gave several of Ms. Frawley’s business cards to an inmate with trusty status and told him to take the cards into the jail and pass them out to anyone who needed them. She also passed out cards to other individuals. At least one of these cards had Ms. Hinerman’s name handwritten with “Sec.” to indicate secretary. All of the cards had both Ms. Frawley’s and J & J Bonding’s names imprinted. The cards also listed Ms. Frawley’s cellular phone number. Although not paid by Ms. Frawley, Ms. Hinerman helped Ms. Frawley by driving around with her and answering her cellular phone. When answering the telephone for Ms. Frawley, Ms. Hinerman would gather the caller’s name, phone number, and information about the person for whom a bond was sought. She denied giving specific information about fees for obtaining a bond and claimed she only answered a few phone calls. Both Ms. Frawley and J & J Bonding would receive the financial benefit of any bail bond business solicited by Ms. Hinerman through the distribution of cards on December 16, 1997, in or about the premises of the Pulaski County jail. Ms. Frawley denied knowing that Ms. Hinerman was distributing the cards at the time of distribution, but said she was upset with Ms. Hinerman when she found out and told her never to do it again.\nThe Arkansas Supreme Court adopted the definition of agency contained in the Second Restatement of the Law of Agency, § 1, comment a, which provides that the relation of agency is created as the result of conduct by two parties manifesting that one of them is willing for the other to act for him subject to his control, and that the other consents so to act. The principal must in some manner indicate that the agent is to act for him, and the agent must act or agree to act on the principal’s behalf and subject to his control. Evans v. White, 284 Ark. 376, 682 S.W.2d 733 (1985) (citing Crouch v. Twin City Transit, 245 Ark. 778, 434 S.W.2d 816 (1968)). The two essential elements of the definition are authorization and right to control. Id.\nThere is substantial evidence from which the Board could conclude that Ms. Hinerman was acting on behalf of Ms. Frawley when distributing her business cards at the jail. Ms. Frawley left Ms. Hinerman with access to her business cards and cellular phone and gave instructions to obtain certain information from the callers regarding their bonding needs. The cards had Ms. Frawley’s cellular phone number on them. Ms. Frawley left Ms. Hinerman outside the detention facility while she was inside preparing a bond on behalf of J & J Bonding. Appellants fail to demonstrate how a fair-minded person could not reach the conclusion that Ms. Frawley in some manner indicated that Ms. Hinerman was to act for her. Neither have appellants demonstrated that a fair-minded person could not reach the conclusion that Ms. Hinerman acted on appellants’ behalf. It is logical to conclude that someone who received a business card could contact Ms. Frawley and J & J Bonding for a bond and therefore the distribution of the card was on appellants’ behalf. Even if no one contacted appellants as a result of the distribution, Ms. Hinerman’s actions were still on behalf of appellants in that she was providing individuals with the name and number of a bail bondsman. Similarly, Ms. Frawley’s instruction to Ms. Hinerman to never pass out the cards again at a jail supports the conclusion that Ms. Hinerman was subject to appellants’ control in some way, whether or not appellants had prior knowledge of this specific distribution of cards by Ms. Hinerman. Therefore, Ms. Frawley is accountable for Ms. Hinerman’s actions. In addition, substantial evidence supports the finding that Ms. Frawley was acting within the scope of her employment as a J & J bondsman, and J & J was properly held accountable pursuant to statute.\nRegarding the sanctions imposed, Ms. Frawley’s ninety-day suspension is not an abuse of discretion or unduly harsh, particularly in fight of the fact that under Ark. Code Ann. section 17-19-210(a) she was subject to a one-year suspension. Likewise, J &J Bonding’s fine of $2500, in lieu of suspension or revocation of its license as an administrative penalty pursuant to section 17-19-211, was in the mid-range of fines. The sanctions are fair and reasonable.\nAccordingly, we affirm.\nAffirmed.\nGriffen and CRABTREE, JJ.,agree.']"
2,The defendant was trespassing,"['Johnson, C. J.\nThe first point presented in this case relates to the right of the plaintiff below to maintain his suit without showing an actual possession of the premises, upon which the trespass was alleged to have been committed. The case of Ledbetter v. Fitzgerald and Wilson v. Bushnell, 1 Ark. Rep. p. 422 and 470, are clear and conclusive upon the question. This court, in the case last re-’ ferred to, said that “The instruction given to the jury is that it is not necessary for the plaintiff to prove actual possession of the premises at the time the trespasses are alleged to have been committed in order to enable him to maintain his action. The doctrine in relation to this subject has been fully examined during the present term in the case of Ledbetter v. Fitzgerald, and the rule there laid down is con sidered perfectly correct, and entirely applicable to the case under consideration. It is true, that, by tbe common law, actual possession, or constructive possession by operation of law, as by conveyance under tbe Statute of uses, was necessary to be proved to maintain trespass; for before entry and actual possession, one could not maintain an action of trespass, though he had the freehold in law. 2 Saund. on Pleading 868; 3 Blac. Com. 211; 12 Saund. Rep. 321; 2 T. R. 13; 8 East. 109; Bacon’s Abrd. title C. 3. But the doctrine is now wholly exploded by the courts of our own country; for, as an actual entry into wild and uncultivated land would give no notoriety to the possession on the change of property, it is declared to be an impracticable and an utterly useless thing; and of course a plaintiff may maintain trespass in such cases without actual possession of the premises, — without ever having made an entry upon the land. For not to give him such a right would be to expose his possession to serious and destructive injury, without any adequate remedy or redress. For if he is seized of a lawful estate of inheritance, or in fee, the law presumes that he is rightfully in possession to the extent of his boundary, and his seizure is not confined to his mere occupancy or actual cultivation; but if he enters without tide, he is confined by metes and bounds strictly to his actual possession. It necessarily results from this position, that a party may maintain trespass upon a mere constructive or legal possession, without ever having been actually in the possession of the premises, and as the title of the plaintiff is shown and admitted by the plea, that, therefore, it was unnecessary to adduce any evidence of it. The opinion of the court was, therefore, correct, in the instructions given to the jury, on this point. ’ ’ According to this doctrine there can be no doubt of the right of the plaintiff below to maintain his action, in case he had the legal title to the land, and that, too, without ever having been actually possessed of the premises. It appears from the testimony that the defendant below was in the actual possession of the locus in quo, about the time of the institution of the suit, and he having pleaded title in himself, and each claiming his right to the possession in and by virtue of his legal title, it follows that the scale must preponderate in favor of him in whom the legal title shall be found. The defendant below having set up title in himself; and relying alone upon it for his right to the possession, the whole case is simply resolved into a question of title. The plaintiff below derives his title from Eliza Higgins, who claimed under a deed of gift from her father, Nehemiah Holland. The defendant on his part claimed through N. H. Fish, who purchased at sheriff’s sale, under an execution against Nehemiah Holland, which execution was founded upon a judgment in favor of Fish and against Holland. It is shown by the testimony, that the note upon which the judgment in favor of Fish was rendered, was executed on the 29th day of May, A. D. 1840, and made payable one day after date, and that the deed from Holland to his daughter, which is expressed to have been made in consideration of love and affection, was not executed until the 26th day of February, A. D. 1844. It is contended by the defendant that the deed of- gift from Holland to his daughter, having been made since the debt was contracted, to satisfy which, the execution, under which he purchased, was issued, that, therefore, it is fraudulent and void as against creditors and persons claiming under and through them. This brings us to the main question involved, and in order to determine it correctly, recourse must necessarily be had to the testimony, and the principles of law arising upon it. It was in evidence that Holland, the father of Mrs. Higgins, on the 22d day of February, A. D. 1844, and at the same time that he executed the deed of gift to her for the land in controversy, conveyed the residue of his land, with the exception of eighty acres, to his kindred, by deed of gift also, and that he retained only the eighty acres. Hammett testified that the eighty acres of land was all the property that Holland had, at the time he levied Fish’s execution, and that that in addition to all the rest specified in his deed to Fish, did not satisfy his execution. He also stated that he considered the eighty acres reserved by Holland to be worth eight or ten dollars per acre. Townsend, a witness, introduced by the defendant, also testified that the land retained by Holland was worth ten dollars per acre. This court, at the last term, in the case of Dodd v. McCraw, laid down the doctrine which we consider is strictly applicable to this case. In that case the court said that “the first question presented here is, whether the facts and circumstances detailed in evidence, and under which the gift was made., were such as to constitute fraud per se, or even to raise a presumption ag-ainst the fairness of the transaction. The fact of an existing indebtedness does not render a voluntary conveyance absolutely fraudulent or void in law as against the creditors whose debts were previously contracted; if there was no intention on the part of the grantor to delay or defraud his creditors.” In the case of Van Wick v. Seward, 6 Paige, p. 67; the Chancellor said “I presume it cannot be seriously urged that where a parent makes an advancement to his child, honestly and fairly retaining in his own hands, at the same time, property sufficient to pay all his debts, such child will be bound to refund the advancement for the benefit of creditors, if it afterwards happens that the parent, either by misfortune or fraud, does not actually pay all his debts which existed at the time of the advancement. ’ ’ According to this doctrine, the gift in question cannot be regarded as a fraud per se, as it is shown by the testimony, that the father retained property sufficient at the time to pay the debt, and there is no evidence that his intention was to defraud or delay his creditors. The correct distinction seems to be, that in cases where the father does not retain a sufficiency to meet all demands existing against him, the gift is per se fraudulent; but where he does so retain sufficient to satisfy all his just debts, it is not in itself a fraud, but requires proof aliunde to establish it. A father in making advancements to his child cannot be presumed to foresee what circumstances may overtake him, and as such, it is all sufficient for the purposes of justice, that he should retain in his own hands a sufficient amount of property to meet all his liabilities. Any other notion would put it entirely out of the power of a parent to render any assistance to his child, whilst he labored under any indebtedness, though his indebtedness should be as nothing in comparison with the extent of his property. The proof in this case is, that the eighty .acres of land retained by Holland, the donor, was worth from eight to ten dollars per acre. The claim of Fish at the time he obtained the judgment only amounted to three nundred and forty dollars and forty seven cents. If the gift to Mrs. Higgins was made to defraud any one, it must have been Fish, as it is not shown that he was indebted to any body else. If this was the extent of his indebtedness, and that such was the case we are bound to presume, as no other has been shown, it is clear and unquestionable that he still retained a sufficiency to meet that claim. True it is, that, in Á. D. 1846, the eighty abres so retained by Holland, and also other lands, did not bring a sum sufficient to satisfy Fish’s debt. We are not informed by the witnesses what had transpired between the time of the gift and the sale of the sheriff to reduce so materially the value of the land retained. Whether it had depreciated in value, either by the mere force of circumstances, or som e visitation of Providence, either of which was equally beyond his control, could not materially affect the question. It is sufficient, that after he made the gift to his child, that he honestly and fairly retained a sufficiency to meet his liabilities. We think it clear, therefore, that the facts and circumstances connected with this case would not in themselves amount to a fraud upon Fish, or those claiming under him, and it is equally clear that there is no proof of fraudulent intention. Under this view of the law, as applicable to the facts of this case, the conclusion is inevitable that the sheriff had no legal authority to seize and sell the premises in controversy, and consequently that Fish and those claiming under him acquired no title by their purchase. The defendant below assigned, amongst other reasons why he should have a new trial, that the damages given by the jury were excessive. We consider that the jury were fully warranted in finding the amount which they did. True it is, that there was some discrepancy in the testimony in respect to the value of the cabins which were said to have been appropriated by the defendant, but it was also in evidence that he ruined the fences, and thereby materially lessened the value of the entire premises. The acts of the defendant were all properly before the jury, and we think that they were fully warranted by the testimony in returning the verdict. The instructions given by the court upon its otvn motion, were in some respects rather abstract, and if taken in detached parts, might have been considered doubtful in point of law; yet it is believed that when considered as a whole, they are not subject to any serious objection. The instructions asked b}^ the defendant below, are all directly opposed to the doctrine laid down in this case, and consequently were properly refused. The judgment, of the Circuit Court must, therefore, be, in all things, affirmed.']"
3,the defendant was charged with murder ,"['Smith, J.\nAppellant was tried upon an indictment charging him with the crime of murder in the first degree, which was alleged to have been committed by striking and beating J. H. Brock with a certain blunt instrument, the true nature of which was to the grand jury unknown, and he was found guilty of the crime charged, and from the judgment of the court imposing the death penalty is this appeal.\nFor the reversal of the judgment it is first insisted. that the indictment was demurrable, because it was not signed by the prosecuting attorney.\nIt is customary for the prosecuting attorney to sign indictments, and it is certainly the- better practice that he should do so, but, in the case of Watkins v. State, 37 Ark. 370, it was held that “an indictment need not be signed by the prosecuting attorney. It is sufficient if found by the grand jury and indorsed by their foreman” (Citing authorities).\nIt is next objected that the indictment does not allege that Brock was dead. The indictment does charge, however, that defendant “did kill and murder one J. H. Brock,” and this allegation sufficiently alleges the death of the person charged to have been killed. Fisher v. State, 109 Ark. 456, 160 S. W. 210.\nIt is next objected that the indictment did not allege that deceased died within a year and a day after the infliction of the wound, -but in the case of Fisher v. State, supra, it was said: “Neither was it defective in failing to specifically allege that the deceased died within a year and a day after the infliction of the wound. It is true our statute (Kirby’s Digest, § 1774) provides that, in order to make the killing murder or manslaughter, it is requisite that the person injured die within a year and a day after the wound was given, but, under other statutes, stating what indictments shall contain and providing that none is insufficient for ‘any defect which does not tend to prejudice the substantial rights of the defendant on the merits,’ it is immaterial that no specific allegation is made of the death resulting within such time after the mortal wound, since murder has a technical meaning, and, when it is sufficiently alleged in the indictment, the defendant is put upon notice that death resulted within the time specified by law to make the -offense of that grade” (\'Citing authorities).\nError is assigned in the admission of certain testimony of witness Carl Burley. This witness testified that he was the night fireman at a sawmill at which he and deceased were employed; that deceased was a clock puncher, or night watchman, and was required, as such, to punch twelve clocks, one each hour; that, after making his rounds punching- the clocks, deceased was accustomed to return to the boiler room, where witness was employed. Deceased made one of these rounds shortly after ten o’clock p. m., and failed to return. ""Witness knew that deceased, usually carried considerable money with him, and, a night or two before the killing, witness saw deceased count his money, which amounted to $310. After waiting awhile for deceased’s return, witness took a lantern and went in search of him. He found on the tram a pool of blood, and about sixteen feet away he found deceased’s body. Deceased was not then dead, but was groaning in agony, as he had been struck twice over the head with some blunt instrument. Deceased was not conscious, and did not regain consciousness before his death, which occurred at the hospital, where he was taken after an alarm was given. Witness testified that the appearance of the tram indicated that deceased’s body had been dragged along the tram about sixteen feet to an opening between two piles of lumber, where the body was thrown-off the tram.\nThere was no error in the admission of this testimony. The statement that the body had been dragged from the place where the pool of blood was discovered was not the expression of an opinion, but the statement of a physical fact; bnt, if it were a mere opinion, there conld be no prejudice in it. Deceased was struck and killed. Some one murdered and robbed him. The pool of blood was at one place and the body was sixteen feet away, and it could not be material whether .the body was dragged\'from one place to the other. The witness Burley naturally suspected that robbery was the motive of the crime, and a search of the body by him disclosed that the roll of money which deceased was known to carry was missing.\nError is assigned in admitting a confession which appellant is said to have voluntarily made. In this confession the details of the revolting crime were told. Shortly after the killing, appellant was seen spending money freely, and, when arrested, he gave a false explanation of his possession of .the money he had on his person. In his confession appellant told where he had hid the balance of the money, which was found at the place named by him, and among other bills there were found two twenty-dollar gold certificates of the kind-deceased was known to have had on his person.\nThe testimony on the part of the State was to- the effect that the confession was freely and voluntarily made, and there was no testimony to the contrary, except that o,f another negro, who had been arrested along with appellant, but who was later released. This witness testified that he and appellant were separately questioned by the officers at the jail, but he did not testify that he or appellant had been threatened or coerced, or otherwise intimidated, or that a promise of any kind was made to him or appellant. Appellant himself did not testify.\nIn regard to this confession the court charged the jury as follows:\n“1. The court instructs the jury that, before any admission or statements made by the defendant can be used against him as evidence, snch statements or admissions must have been freely and voluntarily made, and where snch statements, if any, are induced by threats of harm, promises of favor, or show of violence, or inquisitorial methods are used to extort a confession, then the same is attributed to such influence, and cannot be used against the defendant; and if the jury shall believe that any snch threats or promises were made, or violence shown or manifested, or methods used, the jury will not consider or give any weight to such admissions or statements of the defendant. ’ ’\nThis was a proper instruction, and conforms to the correct practice in such cases. Spurgeon v. State, 160 Ark. 112, 254 S. W. 376.\nThis confession, in connection with the other testimony in the case, is sufficient to sustain the conviction. Section 3182, C. & M. Digest.\nIt is finally insisted that the court erred in refusing to give an instruction defining the crime of manslaughter. No error was committed in refusing this instruction, as there was no testimony upon which to base it. In the case of Clark v. State, 169 Ark. 717, 276 S. W. 849, it was said that this court has repeatedly held that, where an indictment charges murder in the first degree, and the undisputed evidence shows that the accused, if guilty at all, is guilty of that crime, it is not error to refuse to give an instruction authorizing the jury to return a ver: diet of guilty of any of the lower degrees of homicide, and the reason there stated was that, “if there is no evidence to establish a lower degree of homicide than murder in the first degree, the court, in properly giving the law, must of necessity determine whether there is any evidence at all to justify a particular instruction, and it is the duty of the jury to take the court’s exposition of the law” (\'Citing authorities).\nAs no error appears, the judgment must be affirmed, and it is so ordered.']"
4,The defendant was charged with theft,"['JOHN MAUZY PITTMAN, Judge.\n_JjThis is an appeal from a conviction of aggravated robbery. It is undisputed that appellant, brandishing a toy gun, demanded that the victim return two dollars that he owed the appellant. The victim admitted that he did owe appellant the two dollars. On appeal, appellant argues that his actions do not constitute the crime of aggravated robbery because, since the money was admittedly his, he lacked the requisite intent to commit a theft. We agree, and we reverse and dismiss.\nSubstantial evidence that the defendant acted with the purpose of committing theft is necessary to support an aggravated-robbery conviction. A person who commits robbery while representing that he is armed with a deadly weapon commits aggravated robbery. Ark.Code Ann. § 5-12-103(a)(2) (Repl.2006). Robbery is committed when a person employs or threatens to immediately employ physical force with the purpose of committing theft. |2Ark.Code Ann. § 5-12-10(a) (Repl.2006). Theft is taking the property of another person with the purpose of depriving the owner of that property. Ark. Code Ann. § 5-36-103(a)(l) (Repl.2006).\nThe crucial question in this case is whether the prosecution presented substantial evidence to show that the two dollars was “the property of another person.” In Davidson v. State, 200 Ark. 495, 139 S.W.2d 409 (1940), the Arkansas Supreme Court discussed earlier case law addressing the question of whether property was “the property of another” so as to support a conviction of robbery:\nIn the case of Rugless v. State, 97 Ark. 152, 133 S.W. 600 [(1911)], the headnote reads as follows: “A conviction of robbery will not be sustained by evidence that the taking was accompanied by putting the owner in fear, but that the taking was in the presence of others under claim of title.” It was so held in this Rugless case upon the authority of the case of Brown v. State, 28 Ark. 126 [ (1873) ], in which the facts were as follows. Brown took from the possession of Frank two bales of cotton the title to which he claimed just as Frank was about to have them loaded on a steamboat for shipment. He did this by brandishing his pistol and declaring that he would shoot any one who touched the cotton. In reversing a judgment finding Brown guilty of robbery, the court said that, while Brown’s conduct in taking possession of the cotton by force was a violation of the law, it did not constitute the crime of robbery, inasmuch as he had taken possession of the cotton under a claim of title.\nDavidson, 200 Ark. at 499, 139 S.W.2d at 411.\nSubstantial evidence is that which is of sufficient force and character that it will, with reasonable certainty, compel a conclusion one way or the other, without resorting to speculation or conjecture. Haynes v. State, 346 Ark. 388, 58 S.W.3d 336 (2001). Here, appellant expressly argued below that, although his action could have been found to be in | .¡violation of the law, it was not robbery because the property taken was his own. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, the only evidence of ownership in this case consisted of the victim’s admission that he “owed” appellant the money, a term that embraces a variety of legal relationships ranging from installment payments for debt to restitution for stolen property. In effect, the victim in this case conceded that appellant had a right to the money without asserting any right of his own. In light of this admission, and because there was no testimony that appellant loaned or even knowingly surrendered the two dollars to the victim, we hold that there is no substantial evidence that appellant threatened violence in order to obtain “the property of another.”\nReversed and dismissed.\nMARSHALL and HENRY, JJ, agree.']"
5,The defendant was charged with arson ,"[""English, C. J.\nThe appellant was- indicted in the circuit court of Poinsett county, for arson; the venue was changed, on his application, to the circuit court of Cross county, where he was tried on the plea of not guilty, and the jury found him guilty; he moved in arrest of judgment, which was overruled, and he was sentenced to the penitentiary. After sentence, he. offered to file a motion for a new trial, which the court refused him permission to do, and lie excepted, and obtained an appeal.\nThe cause assigned for the arrest of judgment is, that the facts charged 'in the indictment do not constitute a public offense, within the jurisdiction of the court.\nThe indictment,-after the usual caption, is as follows,:\n“The grand jurors of Poinsett county, duly impaneled, sworn and charged, in the name and by the authority of the state of Arkansas, accuse George W. Mott of the crime of arson, committed as follows: That the said George W. Mott, on or about the 6th day of September, 1873, in the said county of Poinsett, did willfully and maliciously set fire to and burn the court-house of Poinsett county, in the town of Harrisburg, contrary to the form of the'statute in such case made and provided, and against the peace and dignity of the state of Arkansas.”\nThis is a code form of indictment upon sec. 1340, Gantt’s Dig., p. 338, which' provides that: “ If any person shall willfully and maliciously burn, or cause.'to be burned, ány state house, court house, prison, church, bridge, or any other public building, although not herein specially named, such person, on conviction, shall be adjudged.guilty of arson.”\nWhere private property is the subject of arson, the ownership of the structure burned must be alleged in the indictment, but this is not necessary in an indictment, like the one before us, for burning a public building. 2 Bish. Crim. Pr., sec. 53, 54; State v. Roe, 12 Vt., 93 ; Stevens v. Commonwealth, 4 Leigh, 683.\nThe word, “feloniously,” must, of course, occur in the indictment, where the offense is a felony, as it is at common law. Bish. Crim. Pr., sec. 57; 2 Wharton Crim. Law, sec. 1637.\nBy our statute, every person convicted' of arson, shall be imprisoned in the penitentiary for a period not less than two nor more than ten years. Gantt’s Dig., p. 339, see. 1343.\nBy statute, also, a felony is an offense of which the punishment is death or confinement in the penitentiary. Gantt’s Dig., p. 325, sec. 1225.\nThe appellant was indicted for a felony. The indictment charges that he willfully and maliciously set fire to and burned the court house, but the word, “ feloniously,” is omitted. In. the precedents, the words, feloniously, willfully and maliciously are used. Bish. Crim. Pr., sec. 50.\nIn Milan v. The State, 24 Ark., 348, this court held that in indictments for felonies, the criminal act must be charged to have been done feloniously.\nAnd in Edwards v. The State, 25 Ark., 446, Mr. Justice Harrison said, that the authorities, with scarcely an exception, agree that it is absolutely necessary, in charging a felony, to charge that the act was feloniously done, citing numerous authorities. See also, State v. Josse, 2 Dev. & Bat., 297.\nBy the constitution of 1868 (art. I, sec. 9), under which the appellant was indicted, no person could be held to answer a criminal offense, unless on the presentment or indictment of a grand jury, except the offenses named, and arson is not one of the exceptions. Indictment is a common law term, and the courts have necessarily to look to the common law to ascertain its meaning. And whilst we do not doubt the power of the legislature to dispense with mere matters of form; the substance of a good common law indictment should be preserved. If one matter of substance may be dispensed with, another may be, and where is the limit to innovations ?\nIn Jane v. The Commonwealth, 3 Met., 18, it was held that in indictments for felonies, under the provisions of the criminal code of Kentucky, it was not necessary to use the word feloniously in charging the intent with which the offense was Committed. There the court seem to indicate that the legislature of Kentucky was under no constitutional limitation in prescribing what was material in indictments.\nIn the later case of Rhodus v. Commonwealth, 2 Duval, 159, the court said: “ On the subject of indictments our criminal 'code recognized and established the common law, rightly understood and rationally applied. It dispenses with form and requires substance only. And what is now substance at common law is substance under the code.”\nSuch, too, have been the tenor and effect of our decisions. And this court has repeatedly held, as above shown, that in indictments for felonies, the word “feloniously” is substantive in charging the offense — a word that has a fixed and “well defined legal meaning, understood by bench and bar* And we are not disposed to overrule these decisions, disregard long used precedents, and follow Kentucky into undefined and uncertain regions in the interpretation of her criminal code.\nIt may seem strange to one not a lawyer to hold an indictment bad, for want of a word, or for the use of a wrong word, but words are often important, and the transactions and destinies of man and even of nations have not unfrequently turned upon the use of particular words, and particularly legal expressions.\nThe indictment being bad, for the reason stated, it is not necessary to decide any other question in this case.\nThe judgment must be reversed, and the cause remanded to ‘the circuit court of Cross county, from' which the appeal was taken, with instructions that the appellant be held subject to a new indictment in the circuit court of Poinsett county.""]"
6,Innocent ,"[""Battle,-J.\n.William Spears-was accused and convicted of larceny, committed ■ by feloniously -taking, stealing, and carrying away three-hogs,'the property of--John; Houston; and he appealed.\nThe evidence adduced at the trial showed that the three hogs alleged to have been stolen were the property of John F. Hamilton. The allegation in the indictment was that they belonged to John Houston. The ownership should have been proved as alleged. The variance is fatal. Blankenship v. State, 55 Ark. 244. In other respects the evidence of the defendant’s guilt, as it appears in the record before us, is weak and unsatisfactory.\nBeversed and remanded for a new trial.""]"
7,sexual assault ,"['Richard B. Adkisson, Chief Justice.\nAppellant, Ralph Lewis Kramer, was tried and convicted by the court of sexual abuse, 1st degree, in violation of the Ark. Stat. Ann. § 41-1808 (Repl. 1977) and sentenced to four years imprisonment. On appeal appellant argues the evidence is insufficient to support the conviction. We agree.\nThe victim, a twelve-year-old girl, testified that on June 19,1983, while she was standing in line to get a soft drink in a store, appellant touched her on her buttocks. Appellant argues that the sexual abuse statute does not prohibit touching of the buttocks and that therefore the evidence is insufficient to support the conviction.\nArk. Stat. Ann. § 41-1808 (Repl. 1977) provides:\n(1) A person commits sexual abuse in the first degree if:\n(c) being eighteen (18) years or older he engaged in sexual conduct with a person not his spouse who is less than fourteen (14) years old.\nSexual contact is defined in Ark. Stat. Ann. § 41-1801(8) (Repl. 1977) as follows:\n(8) “Sexual conduct” means any act of sexual gratification involving the touching of the sex organs or anus of a person, or the breast of a female.\nIt has long been held that penal statutes are to be strictly construed with all doubts resolved in favor of the defendant, and nothing is taken as intended which is not clearly expressed. Austin v. State, 259 Ark. 802, 536 S.W.2d 699 (1976); Scarmardo v. State, 263 Ark. 396, 565 S.W.2d 414 (1978). Touching of the buttocks is not prohibited sexual conduct as defined in Ark. Stat. Ann. § 41-1801(8); therefore appellant’s conviction cannot stand under this statute.\nReversed and dismissed.\nPurtle, J., concurs.\nHickman and Hays, JJ., dissent.']"
8,misconduct,"['PER CURIAM.\nhOn recommendation of the Supreme Court Committee on Professional Conduct, we hereby accept the voluntary surrender, in lieu of probable disbarment proceedings, of the license of Luther Boyd Hardin, currently of West Palm Beach, Florida, to practice law in the State of Arkansas. Mr. Hardin states that he pled guilty to two felony counts, wire fraud and money laundering, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas on March 7, 2011. In his petition to surrender, filed with this court on March 9, 2011, Mr. Hardin acknowledges that his conduct that was the subject of his plea would constitute serious misconduct, as defined in section 17.B(6) of the Arkansas Supreme Court Procedures Regulating Professional Conduct. The name of Luther Boyd Hardin shall be removed from the registry of licensed attorneys, and he is barred and enjoined from engaging in the practice of law in this state.\nIt is so ordered.']"
9,indecent exposure,"['Steele Hays, Justice.\nAppellant, Sonia Young, was charged and convicted of indecent exposure under Ark. Stat. Ann. § 41-1812 (Repl. 1977), for nude dancing in a local nightclub. Appellant challenges the conviction on essentially two grounds: first, that her behavior did not constitute an offense under the statute and second, that her conduct was protected under the First Amendment. We find no merit in either contention.\nArk. Stat. Ann. § 41-1812 provides:\nIndecent exposure. (1) A person commits indecent exposure if, with purpose to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of himself or of any other person, he exposes his sex organs:\n(a) a public place or public view; or\n(b) under circumstances in which he knows his conduct is likely to cause affront or alarm.\n(2) Indecent exposure is a class A misdemeanor.\nAppellant raises four points in her argument that her behavior did not constitute an offense under the statute. She contends first that the purpose of the statute is to criminalize the conduct of “flashers” and not nude dancers. The Commentary to the statute, however, makes it quite clear that appellant’s dancing was indeed intended to be covered by the statute:\n“If an exhibition covered by subsection (b) occurs in a public place or in public view, then the actor also falls within subsection (a). However, subsection (a) is primarily directed at the professional exhibitionist before a willing audience whose reaction to the exposure of sex organs is likely to be quite the opposite of affront or alarm.”\nAppellant next argues her performance did not occur in a public place or public view. Ark. Stat. Ann. § 41-1801(6) defines public place as one publicly or privately owned “to which the public or substantial numbers of people have access.” The Commentary notes:\n“Public place” is defined broadly to include any locality to which substantial numbers of people have access ... As expressly stated in the definition, whether the property is publicly or privately owned is not a determinative factor. Hence a bar or even a private club can be a “public place” if open to substantial numbers of people. Implicit in the definition of public place is that it must be accessible to substantial numbers of people at any one time. A place that is licensed to the general public, but is available to only a few members of the public at any one time, as for example a motel or hotel room, is not a “public place.”\nThe establishment in this case was a public tavern, not a private club, and at the time of the arrest was serving thirty to forty patrons. Appellant does not deny the bar was a public place but asks us to narrow the definition to exclude establishments that limit their fare only to consenting adults and forewarned viewers. This proposition is contrary to the stated intent of the statute and one more appropriately addressed to the legislature than to the courts.\nAppellant claims her actions did not involve the exposure of her sexual organs. She concedes her pubic area was exposed, but her sex organs “scrupulously were not.” There is no testimony to support that contention however and the arresting officer testified that people were sitting below the stage and from that position anyone could see the vaginal area or labia.\nAs her last point in this argument, appellant insists there was no proof she was dancing to arouse or gratify the sexual desires of herself or others. We have said one’s intent or purpose ordinarily cannot be shown by direct evidence but must be inferred from the facts and circumstances shown in evidence. Owens v. State, 283 Ark. 327, 675 S.W.2d 384 (1984); Johnson & Carrol v. State, 276 Ark. 56, 632 S.W.2d 516 (1982). Here there was a sign outside the building advertising nude dancing with the silhouette of a dancing woman painted on the building. Inside there was a stage where appellant performed. The arresting officer testified appellant removed a brief outfit and while dancing ran her hand over her breast, down over her stomach and rubbed herself on the inner thigh below the vaginal area. As mentioned earlier, there were thirty to forty patrons in the tavern at the time. From the circumstances in their entirety it is a fair inference that appellant’s purpose was to arouse or gratify the sexual desires of others.\nAppellant’s remaining constitutional arguments are premised on the argument that her behavior was “mere nude dancing” and entitled to First Amendment protection under the Constitution of the United States. We do not take issue with that contention, except to note that the statute and activity in this case do not deal merely with nudity or nude dancing, but with something more as proscribed by the statute. Appellant makes no argument that the proscribed activity under the statute is entitled to First Amendment protection, only that mere nude dancing is entitled to such protection. As we have said, appellant’s conduct in this case was not simply nudity, but conduct that came within the proscriptions of Ark. Stat. Ann. § 41-1812. As we hold appellant’s conduct not to be mere nudity, and since appellant does not argue the proscribed activity under the statute is constitutionally protected, there is no need to address the remaining aspects of the arguments.\nThe court suspended imposition of appellant’s sentence for one year on condition that she “not display herself in a public place for commercial exploitation or sales promotion” nor “display herself nude in bars or beer joints.” Appellant challenges this condition as a prior restraint in violation of the First Amendment.\nArk. Stat. Ann. § 41-1203, conditions of suspension or probation, states in part that the court “shall attach such conditions as are reasonably necessary to assist the defendant in leading a law-abiding life.” The statute lists some of the possible conditions the court may attach, including that a defendant be required to “refrain from frequenting unlawful or designated places or consorting with designated persons,” and “any other conditions reasonably related to the rehabilitation of the defendant and not unduly restrictive of his liberty . .\nThe broad objectives sought by probation are education and rehabilitation, and the conditions of probation and suspension should promote those objectives. It is generally held that conditions for probation will be upheld if they bear a reasonable relationship to the crime committed or to future criminality. 21 Am. Jur. 2d § 570. Additionally, a condition of a probation or suspension is not necessarily invalid simply because it restricts a probationer’s ability to exercise constitutionally protected rights. Id; U.S. v. Tonry, 605 F.2d 144 (5th Cir. 1979); Owens v. Kelley, 681 F.2d 1362 (11th Cir. 1982); U.S. v. Pierce, 561 F.2d 735, cert. den., 1978, 435 U.S. 923 (9th Cir. 1977).\nIn this case, the activity prohibited by the conditions imposed might well involve some protected forms of expression. See, Schad v. Borough of Mount Ephraim, 452 U.S. 67 (1981); Wild Cinemas of Little Rock, Inc. v. Bentley, 499 F. Supp. 655 (1980). Yet our greater concern with this condition is that it may be vague and overbroad. See, In Re Mannino, 14 Cal. App.3d 952, 92 Cal. Rptr. 880 (1971); Tonry, supra. It includes areas of First Amendment protection and other activities as well, that may have no relationship to appellant’s crime, rehabilitation or future criminality. And while a condition of probation or suspension may affect the exercise of a constitutional right within certain limits, those limits include a requirement that it bear a reasonable relationship to the crime and to future criminality.\nU.S. v. Tonry, supra, adopts a test developed by the Ninth Circuit to determine whether a probation condition is unduly intrusive on constitutional rights:\nThe conditions must be “reasonably related to the purposes of the act.” Consideration of three factors is required to determine whether a reasonable relationship exists: (1) the purposes to be served by probation; (2) the extent to which constitutional rights enjoyed by law-abiding citizens should be accorded to probationers; and (3) the legitimate needs of law enforcement.\nInsofar as the condition imposed here includes prohi bition from a nude display for “commercial exploitation or sales promotion,” we find the order too broad, vague and insufficiently tailored to bear a reasonable relationship to probation/suspension objectives of rehabilitation and future criminality. That part of the order that prohibits appellant from appearing nude in bars or beer joints is valid. Granted, the condition may involve some infringement on the exercise of appellant’s First Amendment rights, as would be determined by the form of expression appellant’s dancing might take, but it nevertheless is reasonably related to the offense and to rehabilitation. As to the other guidelines stated in Tonry, we find the limitation on appellant neither harsh nor unduly restrictive, and the purposes of enforcement of the law appellant violated are served. The condition of probation, to the extent necessary to bring it into compliance with this opinion, is modified and the judgment is affirmed.\nAffirmed.\nDudley, J., not participating.']"
